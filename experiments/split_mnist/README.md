# Split MNIST Experiment

The split MNIST experiment where we run four models: the offline model where access to the whole dataset is possible, 
the proposed model with memory, the proposed model without memory, and the model proposed by Bui *et al.* (2017).

## Offline model

Sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model with access to the whole MNIST data set. 

To run the model:
```
python offline_model.py seed=5
```

The configurations and model hyperparameters can be found in the Hydra config file `../configs/offline_mnist_experiment.yaml`. 

## Proposed model

To run the model with memory:
```
python online_model.py seed=5
```
To run the model without memory:
```
python online_model.py seed=5 online_gp.num_mem=0
```
The configurations and model hyperparameters can be found in the Hydra config file `../configs/online_mnist_experiment.yaml`.

## Bui *et al.* (2017)
To run the model:
```
python streaming_gp_model.py seed=5
```
The configurations and model hyperparameters can be found in the Hydra config file `../configs/streaming_mnist_experiment.yaml`.

## Figures and plots

The figures in the paper can be generated by running the notebooks in `notebooks/`. All the notebooks assume the output
to be present in the following structure:

```
- split_mnist_runs
    |- offline
    |  |- {output run folders}
    |- online_memory
    |  |- {output run folders}
    |- online_no_memory
    |  |- {output run folders}
    |- Streaming
    |  |- {output run folders}
```
